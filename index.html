    <h1>What is a Graphic Novel?</h1>
    <p>The term is not strictly defined, though Merriam Webster's dictionary definition is “a fictional story that is presented in comic-strip format and published as a book”.Collections of comic books that do not form a continuous story, anthologies or collections of loosely related pieces, and even non-fiction are stocked by libraries and bookstores as graphic novels (similar to the manner in which dramatic stories are included in “comic” books). The term is also sometimes used to distinguish between works created as standalone stories, in contrast to collections or compilations of a story arc from a comic book series published in book form.

    <h1>What Was The First Graphic Novel?</h1>
    <p>The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck is the oldest recognized American example of comics used to this end. It originated as the 1828 publication Histoire de M. Vieux Bois by Swiss caricaturist Rodolfe Töpffer, and was first published in English translation in 1841 by London's Tilt & Bogue, which used an 1833 Paris pirate edition. The first American edition was published in 1842 by Wilson & Company in New York City using the original printing plates from the 1841 edition. Another early predecessor is Journey to the Gold Diggins by Jeremiah Saddlebags by brothers J. A. D. and D. F. Read, inspired by The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck. In 1894, Caran d'Ache broached the idea of a “drawn novel” in a letter to the newspaper Le Figaro and started work on a 360-page wordless book (which was never published). In the United States, there is a long tradition of reissuing previously published comic strips in book form. In 1897, the Hearst Syndicate published such a collection of The Yellow Kid by Richard Outcault and it quickly became a best seller.</p>

    <h1>1920s</h1>
    <p>The 1920s saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition, with Belgian Frans Masereel cited as "the undisputed king" of this revival. His works include Passionate Journey (1919). American Lynd Ward also worked in this tradition, publishing Gods' Man, in 1929 and going on to publish more during the 1930s. Other prototypical examples from this period include American Milt Gross's He Done Her Wrong (1930), a wordless comic published as a hardcover book, and Une semaine de bonté (1934), a novel in sequential images composed of collage by the surrealist painter Max Ernst. Similarly, Charlotte Salomon's Life? or Theater? (composed 1941-43) combines images, narrative, and captions. The digest-sized "picture novel" It Rhymes with Lust (1950), one precursor of the graphic novel. Cover art by Matt Baker and Ray Osrin.</p>

    <h1>1940s</h1>
    <p>The 1940s saw the launching of Classics Illustrated, a comic-book series that primarily adapted notable, public domain novels into standalone comic books for young readers. Citizen 13660, an illustrated, novel length retelling of Japanese internment during World War II, was published in 1946. In 1947, Fawcett Comics published Comics Novel #1: "Anarcho, Dictator of Death", a 52-page comic dedicated to one story. In 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented "picture novel" It Rhymes with Lust, a film noir-influenced slice of steeltown life starring a scheming, manipulative redhead named Rust. Touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover, the 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer "Drake Waller" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin proved successful enough to lead to an unrelated second picture novel, The Case of the Winking Buddha by pulp novelist Manning Lee Stokes and illustrator Charles Raab. In the same year, Gold Medal Books released Mansion of Evil by Joseph Millard. Presaging Will Eisner's multiple-story graphic novel A Contract with God (1978), cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman wrote and drew the four-story mass-market paperback Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book (Ballantine Books #338K), published in 1959.</p>

    <h1>1960s</h1>
    <p>By the late 1960s, American comic book creators were becoming more adventurous with the form. Gil Kane and Archie Goodwin self-published a 40-page, magazine-format comics novel, His Name Is... Savage (Adventure House Press) in 1968—the same year Marvel Comics published two issues of The Spectacular Spider-Man in a similar format. Columnist and comic-book writer Steven Grant also argues that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's Doctor Strange story in Strange Tales #130-146, although published serially from 1965 to 1966, is "the first American graphic novel". Similarly, critic Jason Sacks referred to the 13-issue "Panther's Rage"—comics' first-known titled, self-contained, multi-issue story arc—that ran from 1973 to 1975 in the Black Panther series in Marvel's Jungle Action as "Marvel's first graphic novel".</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in continental Europe, the tradition of collecting serials of popular strips such as The Adventures of Tintin or Asterix led to long-form narratives published initially as serials.</p>
    <p>In January 1968, the now legendary book Vida del Che was published in Argentina - a graphic novel written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and drawn by Alberto Breccia. The book told the story of Che Guevara in comics form, but the military dictatorship confiscated the books and destroyed them. It was later re-released in corrected versions.</p>

    <h1>21st Century to Present</h1>
    <p>The turn of the 21st century proved to be a golden period for comics and graphic novels. Indeed, the production of comics in book form and the subsequent exploitation of the freedoms associated with the book market saw the emergence of a wealth of material, such as Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth (2000) by Chris Ware, Persepolis (2000) by Marjane Satrapi, From Hell (1991-98) and Lost Girls (1991-2006) by Alan Moore, with artwork by Eddie Campbell and Melinda Gebbie, respectively, and Y: The Last Man (2002-08) and Pride of Baghdad (2006) by Brian K. Vaughan, with artwork by Pia Guerra and Niko Henrichon, respectively. These comics, along with a host of other artful and literate publications, have gained recognition and awards well beyond the sometimes insular world of comic fandom. They have also achieved something comparable to the complexity and density that can be achieved in a novel while transcending the novel format's limitations with artwork that is an integral part of the medium rather than merely being illustrative of the plot. Other models are appropriate too. Brian Talbot's Alice in Sunderland (2007) attempts to draw closer association with theatre, with the text becoming a site of performance, whereas some of Alan Moore's comics, such as The Birth Caul (1999) and Snakes and Ladders (2001), explore psychogeography and take on a lyrical, poetic form in an oneric celebration of the power of interwoven words and images. There also has been a huge influx of creative talent from outside comics, from such fields as contemporary art and graphic design. Andrzej Klimowski's The Depository (1994) and The Secret (2002), for example, seem close to 21st-century versions of the woodcut novels of Masereel and Ward, and his Horace Dorlan (2007) sits somewhere between those woodcut novels, Franz Kafka's novels and stories, and Paul Auster's New York Trilogy (1985-86). These seem to be at once graphic novels, yet not quite comics, creating a further level of ambiguity.</p>
